## The Project

This Slidify presentation is one of the assignments that fufills the requirements for the "Developping Data Products" class offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod).

<img class ='center'src='./image/DevelopingDataProducts.jpg' height=200px/>

The goal of this Slidify presentation is to give a brief overview of a my Shiny Web Application. The app uses the "ozone" dataset from the Element of Statistical Learning package and displays a scatterplot of the relationship between the X and Y variables that the user specifies from a drop down menu. A loess curve is added to the scatterplot. 


The code for this Slidify presentation is available on [Github](https://github.com/coursera-student/coursera_slidify)

## The Data

```{r warning=FALSE}

```

## Access to the Shiny Application

The Shiny application can be access in three ways:

1. Via the [shinyapps.io](https://coursera-student.shinyapps.io/coursera-shiny/) website.
2. By going to the next slide.
3. By accessing the raw source from [Github](https://github.com/coursera-student/coursera-shiny): download the `server.R` and `ui.R` files. Open R and set the working directory to be inside the folder that contains both files. Then run the following commands:

```
library(shiny)
runApp()
```
